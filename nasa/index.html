        As part of its plan to send the <strong>first woman</strong>  and next man 
        to the Moon by 2024, NASA is looking to acquire some dirt. Today,
         the agency confirmed that it will pay private companies to “collect a 
         small amount of Moon or rocks from the lunar surface.”
      </p>
      <p>
        NASA put out a call asking <em> companies </em> to submit their proposals and
        says its open to working with companies outside of the US. NASA
        will require that they provide imagery of the collection and collected
        materials, plus location data. The collected material will become
        the sole property of NASA, and the agency is hoping to secure samples
        by 2024.
